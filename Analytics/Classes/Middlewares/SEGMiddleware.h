@protocol SEGMiddleware

// NOTE: If you want to hold onto references of context AFTER passing it through to the next
// middleware, you should explicitly create a copy via `[context copy]` to guarantee
// that it does not get changed from underneath you because contexts can be implemented
// as mutable objects under the hood for performance optimization.
// The behavior of keeping reference to a context AFTER passing it to the next middleware
// is strictly undefined.

// Middleware should **always** call `next`. If the intention is to explicitly filter out
// events from downstream, call `next` with `nil` as the param.
// It's ok to save next callback until a more convenient time, but it should always always be done.
// We'll probably actually add tests to sure it is so.
// TODO: Should we add error as second param to next?
