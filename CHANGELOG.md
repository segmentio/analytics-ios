Version 3.5.1 *(5th October, 2016)*
-------------------------------------
* Not a recommended version.  Regression introduced in 3.5.0 will generate a new anonymousId on every app launch.

* [Fix](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/613): Removed automatic bluetooth and location info collection to workaround app submission issues.

Version 3.5.0 *(12th September, 2016)*
-------------------------------------
* Not a recommended version.  Regression introduced in 3.5.0 will generate a new anonymousId on every app launch.

* [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/592): Adds a `SEGCrypto` API that can be used to configure the at rest encryption strategy for the client.

 ```objc
 SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *configuration = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY"];

 // Set a custom crypto implementation. An AES-256 implementation is provided out of the box.
 configuration.crypto = [SEGAES256Crypto initWithPassword:"YOUR_PRIVATE_PASSWORD"];

 // Set any other custom configuration options.
 ...

 // Initialize the SDK with the configuration.
 [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration]
 ```

 * [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/commit/0c646e1c44df4134a984f1fcb741f5b1d418ab30): Add the ability for the SDK to natively report attribution information via Segment integrations enabled for your project, without needing to bundle their SDKs. Attribution information is sent as a track call as documented in the [mobile lifecycle spec](https://segment.com/docs/spec/mobile/#install-attributed).

 ```objc
 SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *configuration = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY"];

 // Enable attribution tracking.
 configuration.trackAttributionData = @YES;

 // Set any other custom configuration options.
 ...

 // Initialize the SDK with the configuration.
 [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration]
 ```

 * [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/597): Add the ability for the SDK to disable bluetooth collection. Going forwards, bluetooth information will **not** be collected by default. This is because iOS 10 requires [explicit documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS10.html) on why the CoreBluetooth APIs are accessed. If you enable this flag, your app's Info.plist must contain an [`NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` key](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW20) with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data. On this note, you should do the same for [`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW18) if you have `shouldUseLocationServices` set to `@YES`. If you are linking against iOS 10, you'll want to update to this version to prevent your app submission from being rejected (or provide `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription` and/or `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` descriptions in your app's Info.plist).

 ```objc
 SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *configuration = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY"];

 // Enable bluetooth collection.
 configuration.shouldUseBluetooth = @YES;

 // Set any other custom configuration options.
 ...

 // Initialize the SDK with the configuration.
 [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration]
 ```

Version 3.4.0 *(1st September, 2016)*
-------------------------------------

 * [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/commit/d5db28ab9d15aa06b4e3a5c91f813d5c12a419a8): Adds a `SEGRequestFactory` API that can be used to configure the HTTP requests made by Segment.

 ```objc
 SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *configuration = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY"];

 // Set a custom request factory which allows you to modify the way the library creates an HTTP request.
 // In this case, we're transforming the URL to point to our own custom non-Segment host.
 configuration.requestFactory = ^(NSURL *url) {
     NSURLComponents \*components = [NSURLComponents componentsWithURL:url resolvingAgainstBaseURL:NO];
     // Replace YOUR_PROXY_HOST with the address of your proxy, e.g. aba64da6.ngrok.io.
     components.host = @"YOUR_PROXY_HOST";
     NSURL \*transformedURL = components.URL;
     return [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:transformedURL];
 };

 // Set any other custom configuration options.
 ...

 // Initialize the SDK with the configuration.
 [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration]
 ```


 * [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/commit/b8aed9692e82ad1dbbecfae0ad5fc353a9eb2220): Add method to retrieve anonymous ID.

 * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/commit/98a467292de62eb6179107b6ebbc59f13caf16a2): Store `context` object with every event. This makes it more accurate collecting the context at the time the event was observed, rather than uploaded.

 * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/commit/66fdd8c25fbd28311cc99c0d6ccf8884e065d8b3): Automatic screen tracking improvements, specifically in the case when the root view is a `UINavigationController`.

 * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/commit/1ddcf615942125ecf791a8001794a27f7cb0385c): Don't send `Segment.io: false` in integration dictionary.

 configuration.trackPushNotifications = YES;
 [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
 ```

 * [New](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/573): Automatically track deep links. Please note that you'll still need to call the `continueUserActivity` and `openURL` methods on the analytics client.

 ```objc
 SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *configuration = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:@"YOUR_WRITE_KEY"];
 configuration.trackDeepLinks = YES;
 [SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:configuration];
 ```

 * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/565): Limit queue size to 1000. This will prevent crashes/memory issues from the queue being too large.
 * [Fix](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/563): Replace Foundation import with UIKit import.
 * [Improvement](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-ios/pull/567): Exclude cache files from backup.
